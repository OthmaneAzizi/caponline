<strong>COVID-19</strong>
<p>
The Spice House is registered with the Food and Drug Administration and inspected by local health departments. We have always followed strict food safety standards. This includes documented procedures and required training for all employees. We updated our documented procedures in February to address new threats posed by COVID-19. Specifically, we have:
<ul><li>
Enhanced our already-aggressive sanitization procedures with additional focus on surfaces used for packaging and fulfillment.</li>
<li>Implemented and enforced strict social distancing requirements.</li>
<li>Issued face masks to all employees and required their use at all times.</li>
<li>Discouraged the use of public transportation and made alternative arrangements for employee transportation.</li>
</ul>
To preserve social distancing we created a second shift at our warehouse. Rather than filling our building during daylight hours, we extended the day to make sure everyone has ample space at all times.
